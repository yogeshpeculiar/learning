Before connecting the device download the device driver from the device
website in our case:

[**https://developer.samsung.com/mobile/android-usb-driver.html**](https://developer.samsung.com/mobile/android-usb-driver.html)

**to check the connection with the real device we ll use ADB(Android
Debug Bridge)**

to use it:

type sdk in settingscopy the path of sdk\--\>go to terminaltype **(path
copied)/platform-tools/adb.exe devices**

**note: change the braces in the path**

**Android manifest.xml**

This defines overall structure of the android app.

**Exploring AndroidManifest.xml**

Here the **application label** is the name of the application that we
see below the application icon.

the activity tag defines an activity .

Here we define the main activity.

**Exploring mainActivity.java**

Here we have **onCreate()** which is called on the creation of the app.

**setContentView** is the graphical representation of the activity.

We have graphical representation of the activity and also a
xml(**activity\_main.xml**) file that renders the graphical
representation of the activity.

**Drawables**

General **concept of graphics** that android draws.

**Bitmap**

it is a type of **drawable** that provides

-   **Png**

-   **Jpg**

-   **Gif**

**Screen density**

The **number of pixels that share a physical area** of the screen.

Therefore we **should not declare the size of image in pixels**.

Then what to use??

We go for **dp** that is **Density independent Pixels.**

**[Launcher Icon]{.underline}**

It should be placed in **mipmap** folder rather than **drawable**
folder.

Navigate to resright click on resnewimage assertassert type (Launcher
icon)

**Using the icon**

In **AndroidManifest.xml** :

In **application tag**:

Give android:icon=**"\@mipmap/ic\_launcher"**

**RESOURCE FOLDER(res)**

height="3.419372265966754in"}

**To change the spec according to the screen size.**

Go to appright click on itcreate a new resource folderensure it is on
valueschoose screen width/height.

On doing this a new **value** folder will be created for the given
screen size.

So how do android knows which value folder has to be loaded in which
case??

While building android takes the device configuration and the basis of
that it decides the value folder to be loaded.

**To change the spec according to the android version**

Go to appright click on itcreate a new resource folderensure it is on
valuesversion(choose the quantifiers as version)and give the value as 21
which means on android OS of versions 21 and above will be applicatbe
for the style and values under this folder .

**Quantifiers:** It is the factor by which you want to classify the
devices and different styles and design has to be made for these
classifications.

Few style instances:

Global android:theme

v-14 android:Theme.Holo

v-21 android:theme.Material

**what to do if we want to change the text to blue color??**

The common way is to go and change in the **style.xml** of the default
**value** folder.

But since we have two more value folder (one for v14 above and for v21
above). So there the font color will not be changed.

Therefore in order to make the change in all the version we have to keep
a style in default value folder.(say "AppBaseTheme" in the below
picture).

This style should have the styling code which should vary with the
version.

And we should have another style that inherits the "AppBaseTheme" , this
consists of the styling code that is common and should be applied
irrespective of the versions.

\# Android Hello World\
\
In Android the Hello World example is generated by the IDE, bundled with
state-of-the-art best\
practices. Over the years it has become more and more complex, and
getting rather overwhelming for\
first-timers.\
\
This repository starts from the bare bones and add one concept at a time
for a gentler introduction\
to the Android environment.\
